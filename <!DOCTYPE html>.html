          this is the final project of my Bachelor's degree. Its a sound collage using sounds recorded during my final semester at school. Using binaural in ear microphones, I collected ambience, conversations, and any other sounds to create a library. Pulling sounds from the library allowed me to craft them into a collage, which acts as a time capsule of my final moments of college. <B> LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES</B> (to get binaural effect)
